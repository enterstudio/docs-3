**1. Recommended Server Hardware**

> Note: The server hardware configuration varies widely between hosting providers and greatly depends on the amount of traffic expected. The following are server recommendations that will fit most light to moderate cases.

* Processor: 2.5 GHz (4 Cores)
* Memory: 8GB
* Storage: 80GB


**2. Operating System**

* Windows Server 2012 or newer


**3. Connection to server**

* Remote Desktop Access (username/password)
* Temporary Admin permissions are needed.
* Need to assign a temporary URL to the server for the duration of the project (sub domains are fine.)


**4. Web Server**

* Internet Information Services (IIS) 7.5 or newer
* Modules:
   * URL Rewrite ([link](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.iis.net%2Fdownloads%2Fmicrosoft%2Furl-rewrite&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNHslW_84Io3PnG3NyHM07RQ0Jzy8Q))
* IIS must have permission to:
   * Create symlinks
      * ![](https://github.com/sitestacker/sitestacker-wiki/blob/wiki-resources/images/icons/important.png) **The default IIS user “IUSER” cannot create symlinks. A different user must be created.**
   * Modify any file within the Site Stacker installation


**5. Database**
   * Microsoft SQL Server 2012 or higher
      * The connection to the database server can be made with either SQL Authentication or Windows Authentication
         * If Windows Authentication will be used the user under which IIS process is running must map to a valid SQL Server login in order to establish a connection.
      * Optional, but highly recommended:
         * SQL Server Management Studio
      * Note: Use of MySQL with Windows Server is NOT an option.


**6. PHP**

* PHP 5.6.x or latest stable version
   * Download PHP [here](http://php.iis.net/)
   * PHP must also be available as a command in CLI
* Extensions:
   * php_curl
   * php_gd2
   * php_pdo_sqlsrv
   * php_soap
   * php_sockets
   * php_wincache (optional, if WinCache is used)
      * Version 1.3.5 or newer ([link](http://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/releases/wincache/))
      * WinCache must be available in Command Prompt (wincache.enablecli=On)
      * If WinCache 1.3.7 or newer is installed wincache.reroute_enabled must be set to Off
   * php_mbstring (this is needed by CakePdf)
   * php_openssl
* Settings:
   * short_open_tag=On
   * allow_url_fopen=On
   * session.auto_start=Off
   * date.timezone=[`the server’s timezone`]
   * memory_limit=128M
   * soap.wsdl_cache_enabled=On
   * soap.wsdl_cache_dir=C:\Windows\Temp
   * DOMDocument (don’t use `--disable-dom` when compiling PHP)


**7. ionCube loader latest version ([link](http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ioncube.com%2Floaders.php&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNH2yLN9XjURVWA2ZIoDL3-EdsFG-g))**


**8. Java**

* Optional, if Search component is used:
   * We recommend installing the **Java 8 update 45 or later**, or **Java 7 update 79 or later**. Previous versions of Java 7 are known to have bugs that can cause index corruption and data loss. Only Oracle’s Java and the OpenJDK are supported. The same JVM version should be used on all Elasticsearch nodes and clients.


**9. ElasticSearch**
* Install from here [Elasticsearch](https://github.com/sitestacker/sitestacker-wiki/wiki/Install-elasticsearch)
* The official guide can be found [Here](https://www.google.com/url?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.elastic.co%2Fguide%2Fen%2Felasticsearch%2Freference%2Fcurrent%2Fsetup.html&sa=D&sntz=1&usg=AFQjCNG1Wa040IUIoTIfd3GoEbFqbH_o9Q)
* Is it very important that ElasticSearch be setup to run always as a service and will restart automatically after server reboots.


**10. Mail Server**
* The server will need the default mail server setup and running.  Using the default mail server that comes with the OS should work with PHP without any tweeking.  (Changing the default mail server to something else has the potential of interrupting the interaction with PHP.) Make sure the mail server is setup and working.  

**11. Backup**
* It is very important to make sure daily backup is in place.  Because much of the project is labor and setup, it is critical this be in place and working.
* We recommend that a backup audit be done a couple times to insure all is well.
